## The Kannjan Trooper
Oh, that these mine eyes would cease from failing me.\
Oh, that these mine hands would breed wholly nano-beasts.\
Drudgery is ember and thought for nought fire.\
Therefore I see with the leasts, the less you are the more you acquire.\
Alas, for foolishness corrupts and men cease not from erring.\
Alway be of a sharp mind for thine enemies rest not.\
Study, train, execute lest ye be taken aback.
