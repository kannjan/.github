## The Kannjan Trooper
Oh, that these mine eyes would cease from failing me.\
Oh, that these mine hands would breed wholly nano-beasts.\
Drudgery is ember and thought for nought fire.\
Therefore I see with the leasts, the less you are the more you acquire.\
Alas, for foolishness corrupts and men cease not from erring.\
Alway be of a sharp mind for thine enemies rest not.\
Study, train, execute lest ye be taken aback.

# SIMPLICITY
### The art of clean code CHP1 page 3 (How complexity harms your productivity)

* Declutter your day, do fewer tasks, and focus your efforts on the tasks that matter. 80/20 principle
* Strip away all the unecessary features and focus on the Minimum Viable Product. Ship it and validate hypothesis quickly and efficiently.
* Write simple and concise code wherever you can.
* Reduce time and effort spent on premature optimization - optimizing code without need is one of the major reasons for unnecessary complexity.
* Work with large chunck of time for programming to obtain the state of flow.
* Apply the Unix philosophy of focusing code functions on one objective only ("Do One Thing Well").
* Apply simplicity in design to create beautiful, clean, and focused user interfaces that are easy to use and intuitive.
